<h3><span>Ph.D.</span></h3>
<div class="section">
  <p>
    Thank you for your interest in my research group!
    <b>I am hiring Ph.D. students</b> in the upcoming admissions cycle.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are already admitted to the UCSB CS Ph.D. program, please email me directly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Otherwise, due to the large volume of inquiries I receive, I am unable to give a personal response to every message or conduct interviews prior to the applications process.
    Prospective Ph.D. students should apply to the UCSB CS Ph.D. program following <a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/education/graduate/how-to-apply">the instructions</a>.
    Mention my name in your application to ensure that I see it.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research usually includes hardware experiments and/or a significant theory component.
    Therefore, I am seeking highly motivated students to work with hardware or prove theorems &mdash; or both!
    If your background does not include either of these, you are still encouraged to apply, but please discuss the change of direction in your statement of purpose.
  </p>

<h3><span>application advice</span></h3>
<div class="section">
  <p>
    The reader of your Ph.D. application is making an educated guess about your ability to complete research projects and publish the results.
    This guess will be informed by questions like:
  <p>

  <ul class="bulletlist">
    <li>What are your long-term career goals?
    <li>Has your background prepared you for the kind of research you want to do?
    <li>Have you worked on research projects? What was your role? What was the outcome?
    <li>Is there other evidence of motivation, tenacity, ability?
    <li>How have your overall life circumstances affected your academic trajectory?
    <li>Can you write clearly?
    <li>Do people like working with you?
    <li>Are your interests a good match to the faculty you mention?
  </ul>

  <p>
    Most of the information needed to answer these questions was set in the past, but it is spread out over many places &mdash; including the inner thoughts of your colleagues!
    The main function of your application is to gather all of this information into a neat package.
  </p>

  <p>
    The statement of purpose is the place to discuss your interests/goals and give a sense of your personality, as well as summarize your profile.
    It is also an opportunity to add factual information that is not captured by the rest of your materials.
    <b>Limit vague statements</b> like "I am fascinated by the possibilities of robotics"; they can almost always be improved.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your institution has a writing center or a program to help its undergrads apply for grad school, use them!
  </p>

<h3><span>learning resources</span></h3>
<div class="section">
  <p>
    Students have asked for learning material related to my research interests.
    Please stay tuned for my course materials in the future!
    For now, I recommend studying the materials from some recently offered robot learning courses:
    <ul class="bulletlist">
      <li><a href="https://16-831-s24.github.io/">
        Guanya Shi's at Carnegie Mellon</a>
      <li><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4756/2023sp/">
        Sanjiban Choudhury's at Cornell</a>
      <li><a href="https://qureshiahmed.github.io/sp24.html">
        Ahmed H. Qureshi's at Purdue</a>
      <li><a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599g/23wi/">
        Abhishek Gupta's at UW</a>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    These courses all give broad overviews of how learning can be incorporated into robotics rather than focusing on the details of one formulation/approach.
